# push_swap
/!\ WORK IN PROGRESS /!\ : The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. I have at my disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. My goal is to sort them effectively with less possible instructions.
